* Implemented decision trees in Racket
* Built a Decision tree, to predict the logical output(binary classification) of a test data, using the available train data
* Implemented a Decision function that at each node chooses the optimal attribute, from the train data, which
gives a maximum entropy change and distributes the train data onto branches wrt that attribute
